# Financial-Analysis
Our Professor had us create a portfolio of 3 stocks for an imaginary investor and had us present a portfolio pitch to this person 
with the idea of getting them to 1 million dollars into our portfolio. Technical, industry, company and fundamental analysis  were done 
with this goal in mind.
